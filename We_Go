    <pre>
    [Verse 1]
    I first met you in
    Late September
    But I know, I know, I know, I know

    It's a strange thing
    To remember
    So I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go

    [Chorus]
    There's a feeling
    Deep in my bones
    My tongue is tied
    But it always feels like I'm home

    My palms are sweaty
    My mouth gets dry
    It only happens with you
    And I don't know why

    [Verse 2]
    Behind those eyes there's
    Something you know, you know, you know, you know

    I want to see in
    Inside your heart
    But you go, you go, you go, you go
    
    [Chorus]
    There's a feeling
    Deep in my bones
    My tongue is tied
    But it always feels like I'm home

    My palms are sweaty
    My mouth gets dry
    It only happens with you
    And I don't know why

    [Verse 3]
    I think I'm fallin' for you
    'Cause I've come so un-glued
    You amaze me
    And make me crazy too

    [Chorus 2]
    There's a feeling
    Deep in my bones
    My tongue is tied
    But it always feels like I'm home

    My palms are sweaty
    My mouth gets dry
    It only happens with you
    And now I know why
    [Outro]
    In the quiet
    In the moonlight
    Can we go, we go, we go, we go?
